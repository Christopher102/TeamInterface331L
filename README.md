# StatPy
### A STATIC VERSION OF PYTHON
###### BY: CHRIS FIOTI, NICHOLAS PETRILLI, BRANDON ALKER
## Introduction
StatPy is a language designed to be a strongly typed version of Python. It was created to take the simplicity of the Python language, many features of Java, and a dash of a few other languages and make the best of these worlds. The most comparable language to date would be TypeScript, taking JavaScript and making it a strongly typed language while adding on new features as well. The language is best suited for all sorts of simple problems that requires the simplicity of Python but must also be strongly typed. It has a large versatility and should be able to handle many if not most or the problems that Python and Java were and are delegated with today. The StatPy language will be created in Haskell using the Haskell parselib library.
